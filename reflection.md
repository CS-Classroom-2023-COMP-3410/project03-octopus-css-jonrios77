Hello, a little here is a few  things I had to do for this assignment. I have noticed that starting anything like this is usually the hardest for me so I learn just to have a basic starting webpage. That I can then update to what I need. For this specifically the banner was probably some of the harder things to handle because of my margins. Figuring out how to get the top banner to go passed the side margins and top margins were a harder part. I then started from the top down so essentially I started making my headers and did them from 1 - > 6. Then figured out what needed to go inside each. 
That got me to the  octopus section and that one was a little difficult as well because of the sizing of the forms but it wasn't too difficult. Then I moved to the common octopus species and then the header. I have noticed that figuring out margins and how to change white space is the hardest thing for me to figure out.
